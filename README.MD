# Pseudo

Programming language inspired by the specification outlined here: https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260952-pseudocode-guide.pdf

Written in Kotlin and Antlr

If you use any code from this project it would be nice if you could give credit :D

### Still to-do:
* A rather large portion of the standard library (note: this includes operators such as `+`, which are implemented as methods)
